# Case Study 1: Outlier Analysis, Missing Value Handling, Feature Engineering & Model Improvement

This repository contains the implementation and presentation for **Data Science Case Study 1** completed as part of my **M.Tech in AI & Data Science** program.

The objective of this case study was to analyze data quality issues, engineer useful features, identify important predictors, and compare the performance of multiple machine learning models for both regression and classification tasks.
